#  Distilling Stable Diffusion using Generative AI (Low-Resource Proof of Concept)

This project presents a lightweight, low-resource pipeline for generating synthetic cracked-glass images using Generative AI and training an object detection model (YOLOv5) entirely on this synthetic data â€” all done **on a CPU-only setup** (Mac M2, no GPU required).

Despite low image fidelity from the distilled student generator, the results show that structural relevance is sufficient to train a working fault detector, demonstrating that **realism isn't always required for functional training**.

## Key Highlights

-  **Stable Diffusion** used to generate high-quality cracked-glass images (teacher model)
-  **Distilled Student Generator** trained with L1 loss to mimic teacher images on low compute
-  **SSIM Comparison** shows structural similarity despite poor visual quality
-  **YOLOv5 trained** on student-generated images with dummy labels for defect detection
-  **Mac M2 CPU-only** implementation: no GPU used

# Distilling-Stable-Diiffusion
a proof of concept for using Generative AI to train computer vision models with minimal computational resources. By distilling a large text-to-image diffusion model (Stable Diffusion) into a lightweight convolutional generator, we generate synthetic cracked-glass images on a CPU-only system.
